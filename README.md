Decided to use *EJS* instead of *PUG* because:
- I don't like PUG, it looks too much like Python (nothing wrong with Python, I just want to be around JS style/syntax).
- EJS gives me the granularity of raw HTML.
- EJS is literally just HTML with embedded JS, and I like that.
- Since the tutorial was in PUG, using EJS prevented me from being lazy, and just copying and pasting the solutions.
